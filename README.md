# Rcourses

This is a repos where I am intending to put the courses about R that I am able to share.

For now, there is only one course about [**{dplyr}** version 1.0.0](https://github.com/courtiol/Rcourses/blob/master/dplyr_1_0_0/)

Please fill free to reuse, update (via PR), comment (via issues)

It will take me some time to get to sort, refresh, and move around my other courses, appologies for that...
